# [Project list]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) #
We also maintain a [list of projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) that we are currently working on. Right now, we are using it to apply as an open source organisation to [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), but you can have a look at it to get a glimpse of our future plans or simply as an inspiration for your own project.
