Online edition of "Simply Logical: Intelligent Reasoning by Example" is [live]({{ site.bookURL }}). Furthermore, you don't have to install SWI-Prolog locally on your machine to enjoy the code examples. The online edition has been enhanced with interactive Prolog code blocks, based on [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/), so you can execute them directly in your web browser.

Now there is no excuse to get down to some Prolog!
