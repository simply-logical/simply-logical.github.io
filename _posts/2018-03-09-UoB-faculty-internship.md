Are you an undergraduate student in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Bristol? Are you interested in Artificial Intelligence, Logic Programming and Web Development? Then apply for the University of Bristol, Faculty of Engineering summer internship scheme!

# Work with Simply Logical over the summer #
The aim of this summer project is to further develop innovative online teaching tools for Artificial Intelligence. The project is concerned with improving the existing codebase of the online edition of the "[Simply Logical](http://book.simply-logical.space)" AI textbook, and to develop further interactive lecture material. The book was written to embody a "teaching by showing, learning by doing" philosophy that we now want to fully exploit by means of modern technologies available today, in particular JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Prolog and Python.

The project is described in full detail at [simply-logical.space/projects](/projects/). For more background about the project you can read this [blog post](http://simply-logical.space/blog/2018-01-19-GSoC-2018-projects/#our-goals).

The applications are open **only** to current University of Bristol, Faculty of Engineering undergraduate students. Details on how to apply are available [here](https://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/currentstudents/ilo/facultyinternships).
