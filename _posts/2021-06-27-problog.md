title: ProbLog extension for Jupyter Book
tags: [general, book]
---

We have just released a brand new extension for [Jupyter Book] that allows to *auto-magically* create *native*, interactive [ProbLog] code boxes using a simple ([MyST]) Markdown syntax.

The extension source code is hosted on GitHub, in the [simply-logical/sphinx-problog] repository.
To insert a simple interactive code box, it's enough to list the ProbLog code within the *problog* directive:
````Markdown
```{problog} problog:box-id
problog :- code.
```
````

To help you get started with your executable [Jupyter Book] infused with interactive ProbLog code boxes, we published a simple template on GitHub.
It is available in the [simply-logical/problog-book-template] repository, with the page rendered and hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://problog-template.simply-logical.space/>.
While the web page covers a range of techniques for including interactive ProbLog code boxes within a Jupyter Book, [this page] specifically deals with the *native* code blocks, thus serving as a live example of the [sphinx-problog] Jupyter Book extension.

Enjoy creating your interactive ProbLog materials!
