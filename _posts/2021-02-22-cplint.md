With the release of our new SWISH extension for [Jupyter Book] -- [sphinx-prolog] described [here] -- in addition to creating content infused with interactive SWI Prolog code boxes, you can also author interactive [cplint] code blocks.

To help you get started with your executable [Jupyter Book] infused with [interactive cplint code boxes], we published a simple template on GitHub.
It is available in the [simply-logical/cplint-book-template] repository.
This template is rendered and hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://cplint-template.simply-logical.space/>, which page also serves as a user guide to configuring the [sphinx-prolog] Jupyter Book extension for use with [cplint].

Enjoy creating your interactive *cplint* materials!
